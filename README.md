# hello-world
just trying to figure this ish out

Hi!  I don't much to say other than I'm trying to teach myself to code (mainly Python rn).  I have been dabbling in coding for a couple years now but haven't yet truly learned a language (time, man).  I like eating, travelling, and existing in my liberal east coast bubble.
